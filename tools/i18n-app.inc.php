/**
 * This is a convenience file to include in your application project. It brings common shortcuts for translation into the global
 * space, similar to how the gettext PHP plugin works. You can either use it, or make up your own to do something similar,
 * like if you are using a service container for dependency injection.
 *
 * It just maps shortcut functions to the namespaced functions.
 *
 * 	Part of the QCubed I18n framework. Designed to operate standalone without the framework as well.

 * Shortcut for the plural translator. In English, this will return the first string if
 * $strMsgId is 1, and the plural in all other cases. For multi-language support, different languages
 * can provide one, or more than one translation string base in the $intNum given. That is all handled in the translation
 * file, and by the .PO plural translation format.
 *
 * Be aware that for English this means that 0 or -1 will return the plural form, which is usually what is wanted. If you
 * want something different, you will need to programmatically change $intNum before sending it here. However, realize that
 * your translation file will need to be aware of this too. You can use the $strContext variable to help manage special
 * situations.
 *
 * @param string $strMsgId				The home language version of the singular string.
 * @param string $strMsgId_plural		The home language version of the plural string. Only two strings allowed for home language.
 * @param integer $intNum				The number to use to figure out which form to use.
 * @param string|null $strDomain	The domain. Libraries should specify their PACKAGIST package name. Tells the translator to look in a specific place.
 * @param string|null $strContext	Rarely used, but a way to handle the same msgId differently based on a context identifier. This context will correspond
 * 									to a context in the PO file.

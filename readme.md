#QCubed\i18n
An attempt to put together a comprehensive, standalone language translation tool for PHP.

This was originally a fork of the excellent work by Raúl Ferràs (raul.ferras@gmail.com  
https://github.com/raulferras/PHP-po-parser)
That code has been moved to its own section of this repository for maintainability, 
and is also licensed under MIT. This p[roject builds on that work.
